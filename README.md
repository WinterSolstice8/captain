# üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è captain

A suite of packet capture and analysis tools for FFXI targeting Windower v4, Ashita v3, and Ashita v4.

## Goal

Windower and Ashita are both great, but they offer different APIs for inspecting and interacting with FFXI.

- `captain` - The logic for capturing and analyzing packets.
- `backend` - A "cross-platform" set of functions that can be used in both Windower and Ashita.
